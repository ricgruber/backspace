						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
						<h4 class="sub-title">Note: This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 23, 2015</h4>
						<p>Thank you for using Backspace™ by WR Industries, LLC (“Backspace”). We provide a private and authentic environment to share and enjoy content among friends. We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have regarding your information.</p><p>Because we’re an Internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.</p><p>Your privacy is extremely important to us.  Our goal is to provide you with a personalized mobile experience that provides you with the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.</p><p>The Privacy Policy discusses, among other things, how data obtained during your visit to this website and use of the mobile application (“App”) may be collected and used.</p><p>We strongly recommend that you read the Privacy Policy carefully. By using this website and App, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, you are directed to discontinue accessing or otherwise using the website, App, or any materials obtained from either. If you are dissatisfied with the website or App, by all means <a href=”mailto:info@backspaceapp.co”>Contact Us</a>. Otherwise, your only recourse is to remove your profile from this site from Settings in the App and refrain from visiting the site in the future.</p><p>The process of maintaining a website and App is an evolving one, and we may decide at some point in the future, without advance notice, to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your use of the website, App, or materials obtained from the either, indicates your acceptance to the Privacy Policy at the time of such use. The effective Privacy Policy will be posted on the website, and you should check upon every visit for any changes. The Privacy Policy is also made part of the Terms and Conditions, by reference.</p><br><p><b>Sites Covered by this Privacy Policy</b></p><p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of our maintained mobile apps, websites, domains, information portals, and registries, including backspaceapp.co.</p><br><p><b>Children’s Privacy</b></p><p>We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. We do not intentionally collect information from minors, and do not target our website to children. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the Website or Products. If you learn that your minor child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please <a href=”mailto:info@backspaceapp.co”>Contact Us</a>.</p><br><p><b>Links to Non-Operators Websites</b></p><p>Our website and App provide links to third-party websites for the convenience of our users. If you access those links, you will leave our website. We do not control these third-party websites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, other websites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from that described in this document. Therefore, you should use other websites with caution, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any website before submitting personal information.</p><br><p><b>Types of Information We Collect</b></p><p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there’s certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way:</p><p><i>Non-Personal Information</i></p><p>Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. We may collect and analyze non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use our websites.</p><p><i>Aggregate Information</i></p><p>We may gather aggregate information, which refers to information your computer or smartphone automatically provides to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the websites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.</p><p><i>Log Files</i></p><p>Every time you request or download a file from the website or App, we may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes. For example, when you use Backspace, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products (“log data”), including information that your browser or phone sends whenever you visit a website or the App sends when you use it to access Backspace. This log data may also include browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Backspace.</p><p>In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using Backspace on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and our settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p><p><i>Cookies</i></p><p>Our site may use a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a website’s computer stores on your computer or a smartphone stores on the system. Our websites and App can then read the cookies whenever you visit our site. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site or use the App, to deliver content specific to your interests. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to personalize and customize your experience so that your visit to our site is as relevant and as valuable to you as possible. For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Backspace settings so you don’t have to set them up every time you visit the site or use the App.</p><p>Most browser software can be set up to deal with cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly, and you may be unable to use those services that require registration in order to participate, or you will have to re-register each time you visit our site. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar. Smartphones however cannot be adjusted to stop accepting local files from the App. While you are on our site or using the App, we do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.</p><p><i>Web Beacons</i></p><p>Our website also may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of our website and the websites of selected sponsors or users, your use of special promotions or newsletters, and other activities. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our website and selected sponsors’ sites; how many people open our emails; and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our website or those of our sponsors. We do not link non-personal information from web beacons to personally identifiable information without your permission.</p><p><i>Personal Information</i></p><p>Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. We use personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service on our site.  We never share this with third parties.</p><p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services – for example, you may link your Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or email account to Backspace, which allows us to temporarily obtain information from those accounts (i.e., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p><p>NOTE:  We will never post anything without your permission, nor will we ever store any of your personal contacts that you don’t want to be on our system.</p><p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, age range, gender, zip code, phone number, profile photo, comments, messages, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you’re using Backspace on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with additional location data.</p><p><i>Users-Only Websites</i></p><p>Information you provide on our registration application is used to create your user profile. By providing us with your personal information on your profile, you expressly consent to our storing, processing, and sharing this information with users you allow to follow you and those you choose to follow.  Your name and profile image will also be searchable on our App to all registered users, unless you choose to hide your profile from search in the Settings section on the App.</p><br><p><b>How We Use Your Information</b></p><p>The information we collect may be “personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you).</p><p>We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Backspace does business, including countries outside your own.</p><p>Instances were we may share your personal information include when we have your consent. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and your email provider) when you’ve chosen to link to your Backspace account to those services or publish your activity on Backspace to them or to let your Friends see what content you have posted at any time for their enjoyment.</p><p>For another example, you can choose to publish your personal uniform resource locator (PURL) to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or email group.</p><p>For yet another example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we’re keeping the books right. We may employ these third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We may also use non-personal data that is aggregated for reporting about our Websites’ or Apps usability, performance, and effectiveness.  It may be used to improve the experience and content of the sites, to make them better, more joyful and to give us information from which to develop new products and to protect Backspace users.</p><p>For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p><p>In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Backspace; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Also, we may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.</p><p>We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our affiliate partners or others. For example, we may tell a business using Backspace how many people follow an account that was created, or the percentage of people who click on a post after it’s been created.</p><p>We may use personal information to provide services that support the activities of the users on our site.  For example, we may provide an application programming interface (API) for a blog widget and the sharing of a collar to the blog.</p><p>When we are accessing your Backspace or your activities on our site, your personal information may be tracked by us in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access,  enable communication between users and track your purchasing behavior outside of our site for the purposes of monitoring commissions due us from others.</p><p>We also use the information we collect to send you updates (such as when certain activity is required, like friend follow requests, comments or likes on your content, and other messages by friends) and to respond to your questions or comments.</p><br><p><b>Information Sharing</b></p><p>We will NEVER use the information we collect to permit advertisers to target, track or tag you while you are on our site or using the App. Your relationship with personal Friends on our site and App is always private, as are your interactions with those you choose to follow.  Once you leave our site and App, however, you will subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of other websites and Apps, which may not have these standards.</p><p>We will not sell, rent, or lease any individual’s personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of this information.</p><p>However, we reserve the right to supply any such information to any organization into which we may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue to track part or all of our commission. </p><p>We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or business, when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our Terms of Use or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, we may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or other orders.</p><p>If you are a registered member of our website and App, you should be aware that some items of your personal information may be visible to other users. Our user databases may retain information about your name, email address, and such other personal address and identifying data as you choose to supply.</p><p>Given the potential international scope of our websites, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information.</p><p>If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection.</p><p>Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 (“EU Privacy Directive”) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, individuals located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to our transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America.</p><p>If you do not want your personal information collected and used by us, please do not visit our Websites, use the App, or apply for membership in any of our Websites.</p><br><p><b>Access to and Accuracy of Member Information</b></p><p>We are committed to keeping the personal information of our users accurate. All the information you have submitted to us can be verified and changed. In order to do this, please <a href=”mailto:info@backspaceapp.co”>send us</a> a request. We may provide users with online access to their own personal profiles, enabling them to update or delete information at any time. To protect our users’ privacy and security, we also may take reasonable steps to verify identity, such as a user ID and password, before granting access to modify personal profile data. Certain areas of the website may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords or other personal identifiers; a password prompt is your indication that a users-only resource is being accessed.</p><br><p><b>Security</b></p><p>We make every effort to protect personal information by users of the website, including using firewalls and other security measures on our servers. No server, however, is 100% secure, and you should take this into account when submitting personal or confidential information about yourself on any website or App, including this one. We assume no liability for the interception, alteration, or misuse of the information you provide. You alone are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please use care when accessing this website and providing personal information.</p><br><p><b>Changes</b></p><p>We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page as soon thereafter as reasonably required. If you continue to use Backspace after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or if required by law, obtain your consent.</p><br><p><b>Opting Out</b></p><p>From time to time we may email you electronic or other information. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic announcements.</p><p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, please <a href=”mailto:info@backspaceapp.co”>Contact Us</a>.</p><br><br>

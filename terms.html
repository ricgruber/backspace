If you access the App from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms.</p><p>If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p><p>The failure of us to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p>Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of the App must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.</p><p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy set forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.</p><p>Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms. Backspace reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose. We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website.</p><p>For us, notice shall be deemed given upon personal delivery or facsimile to an office of the WR Industries, LLC., or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing.</p><p>If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or use of the website after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the site.</p><p>Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Backspace without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p><p>Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Backspace in connection with the App shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Backspace concerning the App. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Backspace or WR Industries, LLC’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
